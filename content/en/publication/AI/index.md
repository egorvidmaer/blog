Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword, but a reality that is changing our lives. From smart assistants to medical diagnostics, AI is penetrating all areas. But it is important to understand that AI is not a panacea. It is a powerful and promising tool, but it requires a careful and balanced approach.

It is important to remember that AI is a "smart" algorithm trained on data. The quality of the data and the correct creation of the model determine its effectiveness. Lack of data, bias in training information can lead to incorrect decisions, discrimination and undesirable consequences.

AI will not replace humans. It will help us solve problems, but control and responsibility remain with us.
