IT is transforming education, providing new opportunities for learning and
development.

* Online courses and MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platforms: provide access to quality education from anywhere in the world.

* Virtual reality and augmented reality: allow you to create more interactive and memorable lessons.

* Artificial intelligence in education: helps to personalize learning and adapt it to the individual needs of students.

IT in education opens up new horizons and makes education more accessible,
interactive and effective.

It is important to remember: this is only a small part of the vast world of IT and AI. The world of technology
is constantly evolving, and we must be aware of the latest trends and opportunities it offers.
