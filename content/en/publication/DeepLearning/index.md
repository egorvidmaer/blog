Deep learning is one of the most popular and rapidly developing areas of
AI. But how exactly does it work?

Imagine a multi-layered neural network, similar to the human brain.
Each layer processes data and extracts specific information from it.
For example, the first layer can recognize edges and shapes in an image, the second can
combine these shapes into more complex structures, and so on.

With the help of huge data sets and powerful computing systems, the network "learns"
to recognize patterns, identify dependencies and make predictions.

Deep learning allows you to create a system for speech recognition, language translation, medical diagnostics, self-driving cars and many other
technologies that change our lives.
