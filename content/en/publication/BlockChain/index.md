Blockchain is often associated with cryptocurrencies, but the technology has a much broader range of applications.

Blockchain is a distributed database that provides secure, transparent, and immutable records of information. It is used in a variety of

areas, including:

* Financial services: to transfer money faster and cheaper.

* Supply chain management: to track the movement of goods and ensure their origin.

* Healthcare: to securely store medical data and control access to it.

* Public administration: to transparently and efficiently maintain registries and documents.

Blockchain promises to revolutionize many industries and has the potential to change the way we interact with information and systems.
